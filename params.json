  "body": "# Penguin Subtitle Player\r\n\r\nPenguin Subtitle Player is an open-source, cross-platform standalone subtitle player, as an alternative to [Greenfish Subtitle Player](http://greenfish-subtitle-player.en.softonic.com/), [SrtViewer (Mac)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/srtviewer/), [SRTPlayer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleplayer/), [JustSubsPlayer](https://justsubsplayer.codeplex.com/) and [Free Subtitle Player](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesubtitleplayer/).\r\n\r\nYou download the .srt file from any sites you like and load it into the subtitle player. The subtitle player provides a translucent window which always stays on the top so that subtitles can be shown on top of the video without blocking anything.\r\n\r\nWith Penguin Subtitle Player, just open your favorite online streaming site, load the srt into the player, and enjoy.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/penguinsubtitleplayer/screenshots/Windows_03.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/penguinsubtitleplayer/screenshots/Windows_00.png)\r\n![Screenshot 3](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/penguinsubtitleplayer/screenshots/Arch%20Linux_01.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* 700+ encoding supported (default: UTF8)\r\n* Auto encoding detection\r\n* Drag & drop SRT file\r\n* Customizable layout (Frame size, Background color & Opacity, Font style)\r\n* Time fine tuning (Fast forward / backward with customizable time interval)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nCurrent Version: 0.3.0\r\n* [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguinsubtitleplayer/files/Penguin%20Subtitle%20Player/0.3.0/PenguinSubtitlePlayer-Windows.zip/download)\r\n* [Linux](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguinsubtitleplayer/files/Penguin%20Subtitle%20Player/0.3.0/PenguinSubtitlePlayer-Linux.tar.gz/download)\r\n* [Mac OS X](https://sourceforge.net/projects/penguinsubtitleplayer/files/Penguin%20Subtitle%20Player/0.3.0/PenguinSubtitlePlayer-OSX.zip/download)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nNo installation required.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Q: \"MSVCP120.dll is missing from your computer.\" on Windows\r\nA: Download and install [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30679)\r\n\r\n#### Q: Does it show on the top of both HTML5 fullscreen and Flash fullscreen players?\r\nA: It is tested and confirmed working in Windows, Linux and Mac OSX for both HTML5 and Flash.\r\n\r\n#### Q: Why does the transparency/opacity feature not work for me on Linux?\r\nA: You need to have a [compositing window manager](https://github.com/carsonip/Penguin-Subtitle-Player/issues/19) set up and enabled.\r\n\r\n## Developing\r\n\r\nPenguin Subtitle Player is a Qt5 project. The executables include statically compiled Qt libraries.\r\n\r\n####Libraries\r\n* [uchardet-enhanced](https://bitbucket.org/medoc/uchardet-enhanced): Auto charset detection. \r\n\r\n####Compilers\r\n\r\n* Windows: VC++ 2012\r\n* Linux: G++\r\n* Mac OSX: G++\r\n\r\nCheck [here](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment.html) for deployment details.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\n####The easy way\r\n\r\n1. Download Qt with Qt Creator [here](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)\r\n2. Open the .pro file in Qt Creator\r\n3. You should be good to go (In case of some weird compilation errors, turn off the shadow build option in projects build settings)\r\n\r\n####The hard way\r\n\r\n1. Download Qt (Qt Creator is not required) [here](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)\r\n2. Run qmake\r\n  ```\r\n  qmake PenguinSubtitlePlayer.pro\r\n  ```\r\n3. Build from the makefile generated by qmake\r\n  * G++ (Linux, Mac OSX): ```make```\r\n  * VC++ (Windows): ```nmake```\r\n  * MinGW (Windows): ```mingw32-make```\r\n4. You should see the executable under ```build/debug``` or ```build/release```\r\n\r\nIn case you would like to deploy a version which does not require Qt libraries in the client's system, consider statically build Qt then qmake with the static option.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
